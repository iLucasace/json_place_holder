# JSONPlaceholder Data Visualization

## About

This project demonstrates how to create a simple web application using Python and the Django framework to interact with an external API, store the data in a database, and visualize it using Plotly. The JSONPlaceholder API's `/posts` endpoint is used as a source of fake data for this project.

## Features

- Fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API's `/posts` endpoint.
- Stores the fetched data in a MySQL database.
- Displays the data in a tabular format on a web page.
- Visualizes the data using Plotly, showing the number of posts by user ID in a bar chart.
